    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sahara Calloway, a second-year Computer Science major from Atlanta, GA. I'm not completely
      sure what I want to pursue a career in, but I'm leaning towards cybersecurity. I'm also interested in coding,
      and depending on how well I do in this course, I could be convinced to pursue web development. Some of my personal
      interests are listening to all genres of music, playing video games, watching anime, collecting DVDs, and collecting 
      the stuffed animal series, called 'Fugglers'.</p>
